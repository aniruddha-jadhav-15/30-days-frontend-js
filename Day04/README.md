# 🚀 Day 4 — 30 Days of Frontend with JavaScript

## 📅 Today’s Focus

Strengthening JavaScript fundamentals through **problem-solving** and writing **clean, efficient functions**.

---

## 📝 Problems to Solve

1️⃣ **Longest Word in a Sentence**  
Write a function that takes a sentence and returns the word with the most characters.
